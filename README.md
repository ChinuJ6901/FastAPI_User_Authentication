Here's a brief overview of how you can structure your FastAPI project and implement the user authentication endpoint with Snowflake for credential checking.

### Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn snowflake-connector-python pydantic-settings python-dotenv

    ```

2. Run the FastAPI application:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

This setup will give you a basic FastAPI project with an endpoint for authenticating users against a Snowflake database. You can extend it further as needed.
